## 📌 Project Overview
**Project OpenMarket** is a digital governance initiative designed to bridge the "Visibility Gap" between municipal authorities and informal traders. By documenting the barriers to market stall licensing, this project proposes a **Mobile-First Licensing Framework** that reduces bureaucracy, increases revenue transparency, and fosters economic dignity.

## 📱 User Experience (UX) Mockup: The "OpenMarket" Bot
To ensure inclusivity for vendors with varying levels of digital literacy, Project OpenMarket proposes a **WhatsApp-based Conversational UI**. This bypasses the need for high-storage apps and works on both basic smartphones and feature phones.
